            <h1>My Job</h1>
            <p>This is a detailed description of the job I had. Oooooh, I know, very very detailed. It was fun, and hard, and I overcame difficulties which helped my company 'thrive'.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h1>My Experience</h1>
            <p>The same thing but another section detailing experience. It's like the job section above but this time I'm talking about a different topic, supposedly my experience.</p>

            <h1>Another Relevant Section</h1>
            <p>Very relevant. Another section. Very cool. :)</p>

            <h1>Notes</h1>
            <p>We can type "section" and the section blocks pop up. Same for h1, p, etc. Another cool thing is that we can do something like "ul>li*2>a", what pops up are 2 li elements with an "a" attached in beween ul blocks. So we can get pretty efficient typing things out like that. I like this part of the program, very cool stuff. So I suppose I can upload an html file to a website and it'll be visible to others. For now, it's trapped in my pc!</p>
